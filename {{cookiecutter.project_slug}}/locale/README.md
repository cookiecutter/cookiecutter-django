# Translations

Start by configuring the `LANGUAGES` settings in `base.py`, by uncommenting languages you are willing to support. Then, translations strings will be placed in this folder when running:

```bash
{% if cookiecutter.use_docker == 'y' %}docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django {% endif %}python manage.py makemessages -all --no-location
```

This should generate `django.po` (stands for Portable Object) files under each locale `<locale name>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`. Each translatable string in the codebase is collected with its `msgid` and need to be translated as `msgstr`, for example:

```po
msgid "users"
msgstr "utilisateurs"
```

Once all translations are done, they need to be compiled into `.mo` files (stands for Machine Object), which are the actual binary files used by the application:

```bash
{% if cookiecutter.use_docker == 'y' %}docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django {% endif %}python manage.py compilemessages
```

Note that the `.po` files are NOT used by the application directly, so if the `.mo` files are out of dates, the content won't appear as translated even if the `.po` files are up-to-date.

## Production

The production image runs `compilemessages` automatically at build time, so as long as your translated source files (PO) are up-to-date, you're good to go.

## Add a new language

1. Update the [`LANGUAGES` setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std-setting-LANGUAGES) to your project's base settings.
2. Create the locale folder for the language next to this file, e.g. `fr_FR` for French. Make sure the case is correct.
3. Run `makemessages` (as instructed above) to generate the PO files for the new language.
