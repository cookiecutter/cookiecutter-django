Settings
--------

Moved to settings_.

.. _settings: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ py.test

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html

{% if cookiecutter.use_celery == "y" %}

Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    celery -A {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}.taskapp worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.

{% endif %}
{% if cookiecutter.use_mailhog == "y" %}

Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^
{% if cookiecutter.use_docker == 'y' %}
In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``
{% else %}
In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. If you choose to use `MailHog`_ when generating the project a local SMTP server with a web interface will be available.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

To start the service, make sure you have nodejs installed, and then type the following::

    $ npm install
    $ grunt serve

(After the first run you only need to type ``grunt serve``) This will start an email server that listens on ``127.0.0.1:1025`` in addition to starting your Django project and a watch task for live reload.

To view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``

The email server will exit when you exit the Grunt task on the CLI with Ctrl+C.

{% if cookiecutter.use_sentry_for_error_reporting == "y" %}

Sentry
^^^^^^

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at  https://getsentry.com/signup/?code=cookiecutter  or download and host it yourself.
The system is setup with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.
