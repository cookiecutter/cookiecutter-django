Project Generation Options
==========================

This page describes all the template options that will be prompted by the `cookiecutter CLI`_ prior to generating your project.

.. _cookiecutter CLI: https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter

project_name:
    Your project's human-readable name, capitals and spaces allowed.

project_slug:
    Your project's slug without dashes or spaces. Used to name your repo
    and in other places where a Python-importable version of your project name
    is needed.

    This is you! The value goes into places like ``LICENSE`` and such.

    The email address you want to identify yourself in the project.

    ``username`` or ``email``. If you choose ``username``, the ``email`` field
    will be included. If you choose ``email``, the ``username`` field will be
    excluded. It is best practice to always include an email field, so there is
    no option for having just the ``username`` field.

    Note that it can be safely changed later on whenever you need to.
