Testing
========

We encourage users to build application tests. As best practice, this should be done immediately after documentation of the application being built, before starting on any coding.

Pytest
------

This project uses the Pytest_, a framework for easily building simple and scalable tests.
After you have set up to `develop locally`_, run the following commands to make sure the testing environment is ready: ::

    $ pytest

You will get a readout of the `users` app that has already been set up with tests. If you do not want to run the `pytest` on the entire project, you can target a particular app by typing in its location: ::

   $ pytest <path-to-app-in-project/app>

If you set up your project to `develop locally with docker`_, run the following command: ::

   $ docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest

Targeting particular apps for testing in ``docker`` follows a similar pattern as previously shown above.

Coverage
--------

You should build your tests to provide the highest level of **code coverage**. You can run the ``pytest`` with code ``coverage`` by typing in the following command: ::

   $ coverage run -m pytest

Once the tests are complete, in order to see the code coverage, run the following command: ::

   $ coverage report

If you're running the project locally with Docker, use these commands instead: ::

   $ docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage run -m pytest
   $ docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage report

.. note::

   At the root of the project folder, you will find the `pytest.ini` file. You can use this to customize_ the ``pytest`` to your liking.

   There is also the `.coveragerc`. This is the configuration file for the ``coverage`` tool. You can find out more about `configuring`_ ``coverage``.

.. seealso::

   For unit tests, run: ::

      $ python manage.py test

   Since this is a fresh install, and there are no tests built using the Python `unittest`_ library yet, you should get feedback that says there were no tests carried out.
